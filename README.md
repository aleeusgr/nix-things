>The [Nix](https://nixos.org/manual/nix), [Nixpkgs](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/), and [NixOS](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/) manuals along with [the wiki](https://nixos.wiki/) are excellent resources for explaining how Nix/NixOS works, how you can use it, and how cool things are being done with it.
